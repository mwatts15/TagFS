KEY: 'I'=Invalid, 'X'=done, '-'=in progress

[ ] Store stage entries in the database before creating another release
[ ] Test for passing an invalid file handle to command_fs with valgrind
[ ] Run valgrind against the new command system
[ ] remove_staged_directory_with_file_contents_fails failure
[ ] Write consistency checks for database startup
[ ] Automatically compress large log files
[ ] Guard against tag-id exhaustion (e.g., check for tag_max_id == -1 on insert).
    This is a _very_ outside case.
[ ] Test for adding non-null-terminated values for xattrs
[ ] Implement revised inode number scheme
[I] Use GNode for subtags
[I] Do cycle detection on the tag hierarchy on insert of a tag
[X] Make acceptance tests run concurrently. They should still be started in sequence.
[X] Add Git tags for database version changes to make migration testing easier.
[I] Find out how to annotate g_hash_table_lookup for splint
[I] Write formal requirements and tests for tag-values and review those for
    extended attributes support.
[X] Guard against violations through `rename` of subfs isolation provided by path_check
    (i.e., make sure we can't rename 'into' a different subfs, violating expectations)
[X] Manage concurrent access to SQLite statements
[X] Write tests for subtag removal
[X] Correctly set and update stage with subtag names changing
[X] Correctly load non-root tags from the database on start-up
[X] Support symlinks. Hopefully, allows for managing files in tagfs without the
    overhead of copying the file into the copies directory.
[X] List files of subtags correctly
[X] Make a remove subtag operation
[X] Check for simple name conflicts and fail a tag delete operation if there is a conflict
[X] Correctly update the sqlite subtags table on insert and remove of a tag
[X] Combine tagdb delete and remove
