TESTING
=======
As noted in the README, you'll want to use at least version 2.1-3 of CUnit to run the tests. Most importantly, you'll need a version that has CU_add_suite_with_setup_and_teardown in order to compile the tests.

There are a couple of options for tests. To disable valgrind on the test runner:

    NO_VALGRIND=1 make tests

To run a specific set of tests:

    TESTS="test_trie test_log" make tests

To generate test coverage information with lcov:

    COVERAGE=1 make tests

The options can be used in conjunction with one another.

    TESTS="test_trie test_log" NO_VALGRIND=1 make tests

One small note: If you want to write a test that deals with startup after doing something specific before shutdown of tagfs (e.g., corrupting the database to see how TagFS recovers), then it's currently easier to make a test in test_tagdb.lc rather than in acceptance_test.pl. In any case, all of the file system state that is stored between runs is in the SQLite database and in the "copies" directory.
