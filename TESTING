TESTING
=======
As noted in the README, you'll want to use at least version 2.1-3 of CUnit to run the tests. Most importantly, you'll need a version that has CU_add_suite_with_setup_and_teardown in order to compile the tests.

There are a couple of options for tests. To disable valgrind on the test runner:

    NO_VALGRIND=1 make tests

To run a specific set of tests:

    TESTS="test_trie test_log" make tests

The options can be used in conjunction with one another.

    TESTS="test_trie test_log" NO_VALGRIND=1 make tests

Tests are set up to run on Travis-CI under my free account. Currently the acceptance tests don't run because the fuse file system never mounts. I have no idea why.
