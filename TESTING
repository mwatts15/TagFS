TESTING
=======
There are a couple of options for tests. To disable valgrind on the test runner:

    NO_VALGRIND=1 make tests

To run a specific set of tests:

    TESTS="test_trie test_log" make tests

The way I'm filtering the CUnit output is pretty stupid--parsing the summary with 
grep. The tests may be failing and the failure just isn't getting picked up. You
can set the NO_FILTER option to see the raw output:

    NO_FILTER=1 make tests

or you could wait until I get around to fixing the filter. Then again, you could
fix it yourself, which would be super cool of you to do.

Finally, the options can be used in conjunction with one another.
