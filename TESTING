TESTING
=======
There are a couple of options for tests. To disable valgrind on the test runner:

    NO_VALGRIND=1 make tests

To run a specific set of tests:

    TESTS="test_trie test_log" make tests

The options can be used in conjunction with one another.

    TESTS="test_trie test_log" NO_VALGRIND=1 make tests
