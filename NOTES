For a filesystem with writing you must have truncate as well as write.
I'm not sure if flush is necessary (since it doesn't do anything) but I have
it in there anyway. There also seems to be a weird problem associated with
disk monitors. Whenever I had gvfs monitor running it would look for some 
info and autorun files one my newly mounted directory. I'm not sure why this
would cause the filesystem to crash (it didn't *seem* to be matter of
recursion since there were only a few getattr calls and none of them would
give a directory name. Anyway.

There are some tags (like file type tags) that you might not want to see
in every directory because they would be distracting/uneccesary. I think a
suitable alternative is to have those directories list as dot directories
so that they are hidden while you can still cd to those directories without
the dot. It shouldn't create any conflicts sense tags with filetype names
should refer to files with that type. That all is ultimately up to the user
though.
