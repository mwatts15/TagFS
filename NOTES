For a filesystem with writing you must have truncate as well as write.
I'm not sure if flush is necessary (since it doesn't do anything) but I have
it in there anyway. There also seems to be a weird problem associated with
disk monitors. Whenever I had gvfs monitor running it would look for some 
info and autorun files one my newly mounted directory. I'm not sure why this
would cause the filesystem to crash (it didn't *seem* to be matter of
recursion since there were only a few getattr calls and none of them would
give a directory name. Anyway.
